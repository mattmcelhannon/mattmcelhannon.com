I have no idea what I’m doing. But here we go anyway.

Welcome to my blog. I hope you find it as helpful, infuriating, and therapeutic as I most certainly will. Just getting it started has proven to be a bear (more on that later) but it’s all meant to be a learning experience for me (more on that later).

So come along, won’t you? I can’t guarantee it won’t be boring, but I’d hate for you to miss out. As we say where I’m from, typically before things go horribly wrong: “Hey, y’all! Watch this!”
